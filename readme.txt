Game Name: Harvest Hearth

Game Description:
---------------------------
Harvest Hearth is a cozy fantasy farming simulator where players start their own farm, grow crops, and sell goods to the townsfolk to become part of the local community. The game features a day and night cycle that paces gameplay and sets a timeline for crop growth. Players can also acquire farm animals to produce alternative goods for selling and expanding their farm.

The game includes a variety of tools, each serving a unique purpose—tilling the land, harvesting crops, and caring for animals. Players can purchase seeds, tools, and animals from the shop and manage them through an inventory system.

A CS 596 concept featured in Harvest Hearth is the implementation of a state machine to manage the behavior and interactions of farm animals. Animals have a hunger status, which affects how they move and how the player can interact with them. Depending on their hunger level, they may walk slowly, move faster, or stop entirely. If time allows, we also plan to implement a custom 2D shader, such as animated water effects, to enhance the visual atmosphere.
